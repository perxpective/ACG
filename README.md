CA2 Assignment for Year 1 Semester 2 (Applied Cryptography)

- Objective of project is to implement a public and private RSA key infrastructure to encrypt and secure the process of transferring an image from a camera to the server
- Encryptions used: AES, RSA and PKI
- Using the Python programming lanauge, simlulated the transfer of image data from camera to server by using socket programming to send and receive packets across a port
- Data images will end up in the data folder under server
- RSA public and private keys of both the camera and server found in the depolyment folder
- Audit log implemented in the depolyment folder as well to track the transfer of images between the camera and server and ensures that the image is safely received and verified before storing the image into the server
